# Journey On — Outreach Tracker

Monorepo structure:

- `frontend/` — Vite + React (mobile-first, privacy-first)
- `backend/` — Node + Express (REST API)
- `database/` — DB schema & export guidance (privacy-first)

What I added:
- Scaffolding for frontend (Vite files, app shell)
- Scaffolding for backend (Express server with `/health` endpoint)
- Example database schema and privacy notes

Next steps (need your permission before I add/install any dependencies):
1. Approve adding dependencies (Express, React, Vite, etc.)
2. I can then run `npm install` in each package and set up dev scripts/tools
