# Journey On — Frontend

This folder contains the Vite + React frontend for Journey On Outreach Tracker.

Notes:
- Mobile-first UI
- Privacy-first: do not collect personal names; use anonymous IDs only
- CSV export support will be implemented in the app (export anon IDs and event metadata)

To get started (after approval to add dependencies):
1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Ask before I add dependencies (React, Vite plugin, etc.).
